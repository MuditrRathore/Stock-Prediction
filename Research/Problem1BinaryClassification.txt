How should we label text in cases where we don’t merely want to know if it is positive or negative, 
but how positive or negative it is?
In my domain, for example, folks want to distinguish between positive and very positive reviews. 
I was thinking it might be better to label the reviews as a number between 1 (really negative) to 5 (really positive) instead of 
just using using 1 or 0.
Also, given that we are using a pretrained model here, can we do multi-label classification where a review might be classified as
 ‘positive’, ‘thrilling’ and ‘great special effects’? Basically like the planet competition but for text



SOLUTION:::While this does not necessarily answer your question regarding multi-labels, with binary classification
 I believe you should still be able to figure out how “strong” the sentiment is by examining the probability of the prediction even 
 if it’s just binary (positive, negative). You can see in lesson 1 notebook, you can get the prediction probability at the time of inference
 and use that as a guide for how strong the prediction is.
 So, for example, a positive prediction (1) with a probability 0.9 may indicate that this is a very positive text.
