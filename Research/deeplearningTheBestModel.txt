Abstract:
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in sentiment analysis on consumer reviews to understand the opinion polarity 
on social media. However, little attention has been paid to the development of deep learning for sentiment analysis on consumer reviews 
in Chinese. The research objective of this paper is to explore the impact of deep learning for sentiment analysis on Google Play consumer 
reviews in Chinese. A web mining technique was implemented for collecting 196,651 reviews on Google Play. We used Long Short Term Memory 
(LSTM) deep learning model, Nai¨ve Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) approaches for sentiment analysis on consumer reviews and 
compared the experimental results. The experimental results suggest that the accuracy of deep learning for sentiment analysis on Google 
Play consumer review achieves 94% and deep learning approach outperforms Nai¨ve Bayes (74.12%) and Support Vector Machine (76.46%) in the 
present study. Our finding confirmed that sentiment analysis on Google Play consumer review with deep learning is outstanding.
 The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, the present study confirmed sentiment analysis with deep learning on Google Play 
consumer review may improve the accuracy of prediction. Second, we create a sentiment dictionary named iSGoPaSD for Google Play review. 
Third, the study compared the result of average sampling data and non-average sampling data. We found that deep learning method with
 non-average sampling data reached the better performanc
